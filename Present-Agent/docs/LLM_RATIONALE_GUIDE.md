## Why Rationales Matter

### The Gift-Giving Anxiety Problem

Gift shopping is **high-stakes and emotional**:
- Fear of giving the wrong gift
- Uncertainty about recipient's taste
- Time pressure and decision fatigue
- Desire to show thoughtfulness

**Generic recommendations** increase anxiety:
> "Here are some products you might like."

**Explained recommendations** build confidence:
> "Perfect for birthdays. Great gift for a friend. Ideal for fishing enthusiasts. Within your $100 budget."

### Trust Through Transparency

Users trust recommendations more when they understand **why** they're being shown:

**Black Box** (low trust):
```
Product: Lure Making Kit
Score: 0.89
```

**Transparent** (high trust):
```
Product: Lure Making Kit
Why: Ideal for fishing enthusiasts. Great gift for a friend.
Handmade & artisan choice. Within your $100 budget.
```

### Conversion Impact

**Data from user testing** (see `TEST_FINDINGS.md`):
- Recommendations **with rationales**: 34% click-through rate
- Recommendations **without rationales**: 18% click-through rate
- **+89% increase** with explanations

---

## Rationale Structure

### Standard Format

```
Why: [Signal 1]. [Signal 2]. [Signal 3]. [Signal 4].
```

### Components (in priority order)

1. **Occasion Match** (if applicable)
   - "Perfect for birthdays"
   - "Ideal for Mother's Day"

2. **Recipient Match** (if applicable)
   - "Great gift for a friend"
   - "Perfect for him"

3. **Interest/Activity Match** (if applicable)
   - "Ideal for fishing enthusiasts"
   - "Great for cooking lovers"

4. **Value Match** (if applicable)
   - "Handmade & sustainable choice"
   - "Luxury & premium option"

5. **Budget Alignment** (if within range)
   - "Within your $100 budget"
   - "Great value under $50"

6. **Fallback** (if no specific matches)
   - "A thoughtful choice based on your preferences"
   - "Highly rated and popular gift"

### Maximum Length

**Target**: 3-5 signals (statements)
**Cap**: 6 signals maximum

Too few (1-2):
> "Great gift. Within budget."
❌ Vague, not helpful

Just right (3-5):
> "Perfect for birthdays. Great gift for a friend. Ideal for fishing enthusiasts. Handmade choice. Within your $100 budget."
✅ Specific and comprehensive

Too many (7+):
> "Perfect for birthdays and anniversaries. Great gift for a friend or family member. Ideal for fishing, camping, and outdoor enthusiasts. Handmade, sustainable, and artisan choice. Within your $100 budget. Highly rated. Fast shipping available."
❌ Overwhelming

## Signal Priority

### Priority Matrix

| Signal Type | Weight | Priority | When to Include |
|-------------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Occasion** | 0.4 | Highest | If occasion specified in query |
| **Recipient** | 0.3 | High | If recipient specified |
| **Interest** | 0.3 | High | If interest(s) specified |
| **Value** | 0.2 | Medium | If value(s) specified |
| **Budget** | - | Medium | If within specified budget |
| **Category** | - | Low | Only if no stronger signals |
| **Generic** | - | Fallback | Only if nothing else applies |

### Decision Tree

```
1. Does product match occasion?
   ├─ YES → Add occasion signal (Priority 1)
   └─ NO → Skip

2. Does product match recipient?
   ├─ YES → Add recipient signal (Priority 2)
   └─ NO → Skip

3. Does product match interest(s)?
   ├─ YES → Add interest signal (Priority 3)
   │        If multiple interests, combine: "fishing & camping enthusiasts"
   └─ NO → Skip

4. Does product match value(s)?
   ├─ YES → Add value signal (Priority 4)
   │        If multiple values, combine: "handmade & sustainable choice"
   └─ NO → Skip

5. Is product within budget?
   ├─ YES → Add budget signal (Priority 5)
   └─ NO → Skip

6. Do we have at least 1 signal?
   ├─ YES → Use collected signals
   └─ NO → Use fallback: "A thoughtful choice based on your preferences"
```

### Examples

**Query**: "Birthday gift for friend who loves fishing, under $100"

**Product**: Lure Making Kit ($99, handmade, interest=fishing, recipient=friend)

**Signals**:
1. ✅ Occasion: birthday → "Perfect for birthdays"
2. ✅ Recipient: friend → "Great gift for a friend"
3. ✅ Interest: fishing → "Ideal for fishing enthusiasts"
4. ✅ Value: handmade → "Handmade choice"
5. ✅ Budget: $99 ≤ $100 → "Within your $100 budget"

**Rationale**:
> "Why: Perfect for birthdays. Great gift for a friend. Ideal for fishing enthusiasts. Handmade choice. Within your $100 budget."

## Writing Guidelines

### 1. Be Specific

❌ **Generic**:
- "Great for occasions"
- "Perfect for anyone"
- "Nice gift"

✅ **Specific**:
- "Perfect for birthdays"
- "Great gift for a friend"
- "Ideal for fishing enthusiasts"

### 2. Be Personal

❌ **Impersonal**:
- "For males"
- "Recipient: friends"
- "Interest category match"

✅ **Personal**:
- "Perfect for him"
- "Great gift for a friend"
- "Ideal for fishing enthusiasts"

### 3. Use Active Voice

❌ **Passive**:
- "Can be used for birthdays"
- "Is suitable for friends"
- "This product is sustainable"

✅ **Active**:
- "Perfect for birthdays"
- "Great gift for a friend"
- "Sustainable choice"

### 4. Normalize Values

❌ **Raw values**:
- "fair_trade choice"
- "eco_friendly option"
- "hand_crafted item"

✅ **Normalized**:
- "fair trade choice"
- "eco-friendly option"
- "handcrafted item"

**Rule**: Replace underscores with spaces, add hyphens where appropriate.

### 5. Combine Multiple Values

❌ **Separate**:
- "Handmade choice. Sustainable choice. Artisan choice."

✅ **Combined**:
- "Handmade, sustainable & artisan choice"

**Combining rules**:
- 2 values: "handmade & sustainable"
- 3+ values: "handmade, sustainable & artisan"
- Max 4 values in one statement

### 6. Contextual Budget Phrasing

❌ **Awkward**:
- "Within your budgetMax 100"
- "Price is budgetMax"

✅ **Natural**:
- "Within your $100 budget" (when budgetMax = 100)
- "Great value under $50" (when price < 50 and budgetMax = 50)
- "Within your $50-$100 range" (when budgetMin and budgetMax both specified)

### 7. Handle Multiple Interests

❌ **Clunky**:
- "Ideal for fishing enthusiasts. Ideal for camping enthusiasts."

✅ **Smooth**:
- "Ideal for fishing & camping enthusiasts"
- "Perfect for outdoor lovers" (if 3+ outdoor interests)

---

## Tone & Emotional State

### Emotional State Detection

Adapt rationale tone based on user's emotional state (extracted from query):

```typescript
interface EmotionalState {
  anxiety: boolean;      // "I don't know what to get"
  excitement: boolean;   // "I can't wait!"
  uncertainty: boolean;  // "Maybe?", "Not sure"
  urgency: boolean;      // "Need ASAP"
  celebration: boolean;  // Birthday, wedding
}
```

### Tone Adjustments

#### Anxiety → Reassuring

**User query**: "I don't know what to get my dad for his birthday, help!"

❌ **Standard tone**:
> "Why: Perfect for birthdays. Great gift for dads. Within budget."

✅ **Reassuring tone**:
> "Why: A safe bet for birthdays – dads love this. Highly rated with 4.8 stars. Within your budget."

**Add**:
- Social proof ("Highly rated", "Popular choice")
- Safety signals ("Safe bet", "Can't go wrong")
- Positive reinforcement ("Dads love this")

#### Excitement → Enthusiastic

**User query**: "My best friend is getting married! Need the perfect gift!"

❌ **Standard tone**:
> "Why: Suitable for weddings. For friends. Within budget."

✅ **Enthusiastic tone**:
> "Why: Perfect for celebrating weddings! Ideal gift for your best friend. Premium & thoughtful choice. Within your budget."

**Add**:
- Exclamation points (use sparingly, max 1-2)
- Celebratory language ("celebrating", "special")
- Emphasize uniqueness ("Premium", "thoughtful")

#### Urgency → Action-Oriented

**User query**: "Need a gift for tomorrow, fast shipping needed"

❌ **Standard tone**:
> "Why: Great for birthdays. Good for friends. Within budget."

✅ **Action-oriented tone**:
> "Why: Fast delivery available. Perfect birthday gift. Great for friends. Within budget."

**Add**:
- Shipping/availability signals (move to front)
- Concise, punchy language
- Remove less critical signals

#### Uncertainty → Educational

**User query**: "Not sure what my colleague would like, maybe something practical?"

❌ **Standard tone**:
> "Why: For colleagues. Practical. Within budget."

✅ **Educational tone**:
> "Why: Thoughtful colleague gift – practical items like this are always appreciated. Versatile for any occasion. Within your budget."

**Add**:
- Explanatory context ("practical items like this are...")
- Versatility signals ("works for many occasions")
- Gentle guidance ("always appreciated")

#### Neutral → Professional

**User query**: "Gift for colleague, budget $50, office appropriate"

✅ **Professional tone**:
> "Why: Ideal colleague gift. Professional & practical. Within your $50 budget."

**Keep**:
- Clear, direct language
- Professional descriptors
- Focus on appropriateness

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Vague Language

```
Why: Good choice. Nice product. Within budget.
```

```
Why: Perfect for birthdays. Great gift for a friend. Ideal for fishing enthusiasts. Within your $100 budget.
```

### Mistake 2: Technical Jargon

❌ **Bad**:
```
Why: Facet match: recipient=friend. Interest score: 0.95. Budget constraint satisfied.
```

✅ **Good**:
```
Why: Great gift for a friend. Ideal for fishing enthusiasts. Within your $100 budget.
```

### Mistake 3: Repetition

## Implementation

### File: `src/server/services/recommend.ts`

Current rationale generation (lines 188-247):

```typescript
items = items.map((it: any) => {
  const parts: string[] = [];
  const facets = it.facets || [];

  // 1. Occasion match
  if (input.occasion) {
    const occasionFacets = facets.filter((f: any) => f.key === 'occasion');
    if (occasionFacets.length > 0 && occasionFacets.some((f: any) => f.value.includes(input.occasion!))) {
      parts.push(`Perfect for ${input.occasion}`);
    }
  }

  // 2. Recipient match
  if (input.query?.facets?.recipient) {
    const recipientFacets = facets.filter((f: any) => f.key === 'recipient');
    const match = recipientFacets.find((f: any) => f.value.includes(input.query!.facets!.recipient!));
    if (match) {
      parts.push(`Great gift ${match.value.replace(/_/g, ' ')}`);
    }
  }

  // 3. Interest matches
  if (input.interests && input.interests.length > 0) {
    const interestFacets = facets.filter((f: any) => f.key === 'interest' && input.interests!.includes(f.value));
    if (interestFacets.length > 0) {
      const interestNames = interestFacets.map((f: any) => f.value).join(' & ');
      parts.push(`Ideal for ${interestNames} enthusiasts`);
    }
  }

  // 4. Value matches
  if (input.query?.facets?.values && input.query.facets.values.length > 0) {
    const valueFacets = facets.filter((f: any) => f.key === 'value' && input.query!.facets!.values!.includes(f.value));
    if (valueFacets.length > 0) {
      const valueNames = valueFacets.map((f: any) => f.value.replace(/_/g, ' ')).join(' & ');
      parts.push(`${valueNames} choice`);
    }
  }

  // 5. Budget
  const within = (typeof input.query?.budgetMin !== 'number' || it.product.price >= input.query.budgetMin)
    && (typeof input.query?.budgetMax !== 'number' || it.product.price <= input.query.budgetMax);
  if (within && (input.query?.budgetMin != null || input.query?.budgetMax != null)) {
    const budgetStr = input.query.budgetMax ? `$${input.query.budgetMax}` : 'budget';
    parts.push(`Within your ${budgetStr} budget`);
  }

  // 6. Fallback
  if (parts.length === 0) {
    parts.push('A thoughtful choice based on your preferences');
  }

  return { ...it, rationale: `Why: ${parts.join('. ')}.` };
});
```

### Enhancement: Emotional Tone

```typescript
// Add emotional tone detection
interface EmotionalState {
  anxiety: boolean;
  excitement: boolean;
  uncertainty: boolean;
  urgency: boolean;
  celebration: boolean;
}

function adjustToneForEmotion(parts: string[], emotional: EmotionalState): string[] {
  // Urgency: front-load availability
  if (emotional.urgency) {
    // Check for fast shipping facet (future enhancement)
    // Move to front if exists
  }

  // Anxiety: add social proof
  if (emotional.anxiety && parts.length < 5) {
    parts.push("Highly rated choice");
  }

  // Excitement: add celebration language
  if (emotional.excitement || emotional.celebration) {
    parts = parts.map(p => p.includes("Perfect") ? p.replace("Perfect", "Perfect for celebrating") : p);
  }

  return parts;
}
```
